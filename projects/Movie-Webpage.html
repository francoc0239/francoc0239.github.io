            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage</h1>
            <h1>Context</h1>
            <p>After learing how to code basic HTML and CSS, Our SEP teacher, Mr.Mueller told us to make a fake movie webpage with our knowledge of basic HTML and CSS. This project was very very hard but it also allowed us to do anything we want with our project.</p>
            <h1>Content</h1>
            <p>My project is about a curious cat finding a hole in the house that takes it to a magical world. But the magical world is ruled by a evil cat name Tac. This idea was able to happen because of the basic understanding of HTML and CSS.</p>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I was able to get throught most of this project without any problems. The only challenging part of this project was thinking of our idea. Me and my teammates already knew we were going to write the story about cats. But we didn't know how the story will connect to cats which is important because we already had the cat pictures ready to use so we couldn't switch to a different topic. so me and my teammates spent time brain storming how we could make a story. This is how we got our story.</p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>One major takeaway I took from this project is to work together more so you can have a better final result. We couldn't have been able to  finish the project without each other because if we did it alone, that would be too much work. Without the other teammates doing other portions of the project, the outcome would have been really bad without each out. This is why I should learn how to collaborate and communicate with others more so I can have even better end results.</p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>I plan to work on how to make the webpage look better because I would like to have a background that has different colors so it looks cool. Something I also plan to do is to change the format of the webpages and the elements. Instead of just putting the images to the right, I should have put them in the middle to make it look better. Other than that I am really proud of the work that me and my team had done to the webpage. I hope that im able to make more projects like this in the future.  </p>
